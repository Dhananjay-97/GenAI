An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. We’ll dive into the most recent statistics and projections below.

## How Much Data Is Generated Every Day?

According to the latest estimates, **328.77 million terabytes** of data are created each day.

(“Created” includes data that is newly generated, captured, copied, or consumed).

In zettabytes, that equates to **120 zettabytes** per year, **10 zettabytes** per month, **2.31 zettabytes** per week, or **0.33 zettabytes** every day.

To put that into perspective, this is how much data is generated per day in various units of measurement:

| Unit of Measurement | Data Generated      |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Zettabytes          | 0.33                |
| Exabytes            | 328.77              |
| Petabytes           | 328,767.12          |
| Terabytes           | 328.77 million      |
| Gigabytes           | 328.77 billion      |
| Megabytes           | 328.77 trillion     |
| Kilobytes           | 328.77 quadrillion  |
| Bytes               | 328.77 quintillion  |

## Data Creation Growth Projections

The amount of data generated annually has grown year-over-year since 2010.

In fact, it is estimated that 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years alone.

In the space of 13 years, this figure has increased by an estimated 60x from just **2 zettabytes** in 2010.

The **120 zettabytes** generated in 2023 are expected to increase by over 150% in 2025, hitting **181 zettabytes**.

## Data Creation By Category

Video is responsible for over half (**53.72%**) of all global data traffic.

And social media is brimming with video content. TikTok is entirely based on videos and continues to grow its user base year-over-year.

While Facebook has evolved to the point where **51%** of content shared on the platform is video-based.

Although public data related to Snapchat is limited, it is estimated that each snap sent requires **1MB**, many of which are videos.

Together with social (**12.69%**) and gaming (**9.86%**), these three categories make up more than 3/4s (**76.27%**) of all internet data traffic.

# What Is the Turing Test? Definition, Examples, and How to Conduct Your Own

Learn about the Turing test—its history, how it works, and why it’s used—and how to conduct your own Turing test to discover more about today’s AI technology.

## What is the Turing test?

The Turing test refers to a thought experiment developed in 1950 by Alan Turing, a mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst, as a way to gauge a machine’s ability to generate human-like communication. Originally called “the imitation game,” the Turing test is a useful tool for studying a machine’s interactions with humans and reflecting on the definitions of “thinking” and “intelligence.”

As we’ll explore in more depth, the Turing test is still useful for learning more about artificial intelligence as it becomes increasingly integrated into our lives. The more we rely upon AI to make decisions, create economic opportunity, and advance society, the more important it is to understand AI’s capabilities.

## What is the purpose of the Turing test?

When Alan Turing developed the test, his aim was to give people a tool for determining machines’ capabilities, particularly when it comes to natural language processing. Can machines actually think or exhibit intelligent behavior, or can they do only what humans have programmed them to do? And can machines mimic intelligence through natural language such that their communications could be indistinguishable from humans?

More than 70 years later, the Turing test still serves these purposes and can provide us with a starting point for measuring AI’s human likeness, evaluating its capabilities, and facilitating AI research. With more insight into AI’s capabilities and limitations, developers can create more sophisticated systems that can perform vital functions in many areas of human life.

## How does the Turing test work?

Now that we’ve reviewed the definition of the Turing test, its history, and why it’s used, let’s go deeper into how it works:

### Turing test participants

A Turing test has three participants:

- A human judge (also called the interrogator) asks questions for a machine and a human to answer. The judge evaluates the responses from the machine and human to identify the responder.
  
- A machine interlocutor, such as the generative AI system, answers the judge’s questions in natural language that simulates human conversation and behavior.
  
- A human interlocutor who answers the judge’s questions alongside the machine and provides a baseline for comparison against the machine.

### Turing test questions

Asking the human and machine interlocutors questions allows these test participants to form written responses that the judge can evaluate and compare. The purpose is to find out if the machine’s answers can convince the judge that the human interlocutor produced them.

There is no official list of questions to pose to the human and machine during a Turing test. Asking the following types of questions, though, can help you tell the machine’s answers from the human’s because they require the interlocutor to generate thoughtful, context-rich, socially appropriate responses.

- Open-ended questions like, “What’s a skill or talent you’d like to develop and why?”

- Opinion questions like, “What is your perspective on technology and its impact on mental health?”

- Emotional questions like, “What’s something from the past that you long for?”

- Personal questions like, “What was it like to fall in love for the first time?”

- Hypothetical scenarios like, “Imagine that you are a museum curator in the future. What artifacts of today would you display in the museum and why?”

- Self-assessment questions like, “How do you think you performed on this test? How human-like are your answers to my questions?”

### The importance of concealment

For the test to provide valuable insight into machine intelligence, the human judge must not know which conversational partner is the machine and which is the human. To ensure concealment during a Turing test, the judge can communicate with both the human and machine through a computer interface that doesn’t supply any identifying information. That way, the interlocutors’ responses stand on their own, and the judge can evaluate them purely for their human-like communication style.

### How to pass the Turing test

After a Q&A series between the judge and the two interlocutors, the judge then evaluates the interlocutors’ responses. Some of the criteria might include:

- Creativity

- Empathy

- Natural language use

- Ethical considerations

- Relevance

If the machine can convince the human judge that it’s human, or if the human judge cannot distinguish between the human’s and machine’s responses, then the machine has passed the Turing test.

## Does ChatGPT pass the Turing test?

Now that ChatGPT has become widely used for so many tasks, one thing people wonder is whether it can pass a Turing test and communicate with the empathy, contextual awareness, and nuance of a human. Some sources suggest that ChatGPT has passed the test in individual instances, but there is no official word from OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, on the results of any official ChatGPT Turing test.

## Limitations of the Turing test

To this day, the Turing test is a valuable tool for learning more about AI. It does have some limitations, which are important to consider as we seek to understand and improve AI.

- There’s no way for the test to determine whether a machine is truly intelligent in the sense that it actually understands the conversation in which it participates. The test only helps humans observe how well a machine can produce outputs that are close enough to human conversation so as to be indistinguishable.

- The evaluation of the human judge will be subjective, based on their understanding of how a human communicates. In some cases, the confederate effect may occur, which refers to instances when a human interlocutor is falsely identified as a machine.

- Human judges may be limited in their knowledge that some test questions address. For instance, the sample question above—”What is your perspective on technology and its impact on mental health?”—may be outside the scope of the judge’s knowledge or experience, making it difficult for the judge to determine if the interlocutors provide sufficient answers.

- The questions you select determine the kind of responses from both interlocutors and whether the responses can provide adequate insight into how human and machine communication compares. For example, if the questions focus mostly on uniquely human abilities like creativity or empathy, then the AI’s responses might expose it as non-human more readily.
