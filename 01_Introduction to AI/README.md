Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

In computer science, it is defined as intelligence demonstrated by an artificial entity. In short, AI is a machine that thinks like a human.

The use of AI has been gaining traction in recent years and with good reason. AI can perform tasks that humans alone cannot do. As AI technology grows and develops, our understanding of it will continue to evolve.
