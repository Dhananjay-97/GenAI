An almost incomprehensible amount of data is created every day. And each year, figures are growing at an ever-increasing rate. We’ll dive into the most recent statistics and projections below.

## How Much Data Is Generated Every Day?

According to the latest estimates, **328.77 million terabytes** of data are created each day.

(“Created” includes data that is newly generated, captured, copied, or consumed).

In zettabytes, that equates to **120 zettabytes** per year, **10 zettabytes** per month, **2.31 zettabytes** per week, or **0.33 zettabytes** every day.

To put that into perspective, this is how much data is generated per day in various units of measurement:

| Unit of Measurement | Data Generated      |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Zettabytes          | 0.33                |
| Exabytes            | 328.77              |
| Petabytes           | 328,767.12          |
| Terabytes           | 328.77 million      |
| Gigabytes           | 328.77 billion      |
| Megabytes           | 328.77 trillion     |
| Kilobytes           | 328.77 quadrillion  |
| Bytes               | 328.77 quintillion  |

## Data Creation Growth Projections

The amount of data generated annually has grown year-over-year since 2010.

In fact, it is estimated that 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years alone.

In the space of 13 years, this figure has increased by an estimated 60x from just **2 zettabytes** in 2010.

The **120 zettabytes** generated in 2023 are expected to increase by over 150% in 2025, hitting **181 zettabytes**.

## Data Creation By Category

Video is responsible for over half (**53.72%**) of all global data traffic.

And social media is brimming with video content. TikTok is entirely based on videos and continues to grow its user base year-over-year.

While Facebook has evolved to the point where **51%** of content shared on the platform is video-based.

Although public data related to Snapchat is limited, it is estimated that each snap sent requires **1MB**, many of which are videos.

Together with social (**12.69%**) and gaming (**9.86%**), these three categories make up more than 3/4s (**76.27%**) of all internet data traffic.
