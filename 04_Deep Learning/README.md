## Deep Learning

Deep learning, a sub-field of machine learning, is inspired by the structure and function of the brain. It utilizes artificial neural networks to mimic the way our brains process information. Deep learning algorithms excel at tasks involving large amounts of data and are continuously advancing at a rapid pace.

### Linear and Logistic Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to analyze relationships between continuous variables. It finds the best-fit line to predict outcomes based on input features. On the other hand, logistic regression is employed for binary classification tasks, determining the probability of a certain outcome.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by determining the output of each node. Popular activation functions include the Heaviside step function and the sigmoid function, which introduce non-linearity to the model.

### Weights and Biases

Weights and biases are the adjustable parameters of neural networks. They are optimized during the training process to minimize prediction errors, allowing the model to make more accurate predictions.

### Neural Networks

Neural networks consist of interconnected neurons organized in layers. By combining multiple layers and activation functions, neural networks can learn complex patterns from data, enabling them to solve a wide range of tasks with high accuracy.

### Learning Process

The learning process involves adjusting weights and biases based on errors in predictions. Optimization algorithms like gradient descent are used to iteratively update the model parameters, gradually improving its performance.
