Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of data science dedicated to analyzing, understanding, and extracting information from text data. It enables machines to comprehend human language and perform various automated tasks such as automatic summarization, machine translation, and more.

### Applications of NLP in Daily Life:

1. **Chatbots or Conversational Agents:**
   - Chatbots provide instant responses to customer queries in various domains, improving customer service efficiency.
   - Examples include virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Home.

2. **Machine Translation:**
   - Systems like Google Translate utilize NLP techniques to translate text between languages automatically.
   - Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems are built using deep learning methods.

3. **Speech Recognition:**
   - Voice-based assistants like Siri and Google Assistant use NLP to convert spoken language into text, enabling seamless interaction.

4. **Text Summarization:**
   - NLP is employed to generate concise summaries of lengthy texts, aiding in quick information retrieval.
   - Techniques include Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization.

5. **Recommendation Engine:**
   - Recommendation systems analyze user behavior to suggest relevant products or content.
   - NLP can enhance recommendation engines by analyzing text data related to user preferences.

### Applications of NLP in Industry:

1. **Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews:**
   - NLP techniques analyze sentiments expressed in customer reviews to understand customer satisfaction levels.
   - Enables businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve product/service offerings.

2. **Customer Support Systems:**
   - Companies like Uber utilize NLP-powered tools for efficient handling of customer support tickets.
   - Tools like COTA (Customer Obsession Ticket Assistant) assist agents in resolving issues quickly and accurately.

3. **Text Analytics:**
   - NLP is crucial for extracting actionable insights from large volumes of text data.
   - Applications include social media analytics, risk management, and cybercrime protection.

Different Techniques used in Natural Language Processing:

1. **Part of Speech Tagging (POS):**
   - POS Tagging involves marking up words in a text with their corresponding part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), based on both their definition and context.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - NER identifies real-world named entities such as person names, locations, and organizations from a given piece of text. For example, identifying "Sergey Brin" as a person and "Google Inc." as an organization in a sentence.

3. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Topic Modeling automatically identifies topics present in a text corpus by deriving hidden patterns among words in an unsupervised manner. It is useful for organizing large datasets into meaningful categories.

   - **Algorithms for Topic Modeling:**
     a. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics and generates words based on their probability distribution.
     b. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): Constructs a matrix of word counts per paragraph and uses singular value decomposition to reduce dimensionality while preserving similarity structure.
     
4. **Language Modeling:**
   - Language Modeling involves predicting the probability of a sequence of words, which is crucial for tasks like text summarization, machine translation, and chatbots.
   
5. **Sequence Modeling:**
   - Sequence Modeling, a technique in deep learning, is used to process sequence data such as music lyrics, sentence translation, and chatbot responses. Since natural language is inherently sequential, this technique is extensively used in NLP.

The Steps required to build a Natural Language Processing Model:

A) Preprocessing:
1. **Cleaning:**
   a. HTML tags: Remove HTML tags from text data.
   b. Unicode and other symbols: Handle non-ASCII symbols in text data.
   c. Removing numbers: Exclude numbers from text data.
   d. Links: Eliminate URLs and web links from text data.

2. **Tokenization:**
   Tokenize text into minimal meaningful units, such as words or n-grams.

3. **Normalization:**
   Normalize words to their base or root form using techniques like stemming or lemmatization.
   - Stemming: Convert words to their non-changing portions.
   - Lemmatization: Convert words to their dictionary form.

4. **Stopwords:**
   Remove stopwords, which are common words that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text.

B) Embeddings and Representations:
1. **Bag of Words (BOW):**
   Represent text documents by creating vectors based on the frequency of words.

2. **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):**
   Represent each document based on the uniqueness of words in the corpus.

3. **Word2Vec:**
   Use word embeddings trained on large text corpora to represent words in a high-dimensional space.
   
4. **GloVe:**
   Global Vectors for Word Representation, a word embedding technique that learns from co-occurrence statistics.
   
5. **ELMo:**
   Embeddings from Language Models, contextual word representations that capture the meaning of words in context.

C) Modelling Techniques:
   Once text data is represented numerically, various machine learning and deep learning models can be applied for tasks such as classification, clustering, or sequence modeling.
