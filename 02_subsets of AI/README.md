# Branches Of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence can be used to solve real-world problems by implementing the following processes/techniques:

## 1. Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science of getting machines to interpret, process, and analyze data in order to solve real-world problems.

Under Machine Learning there are three categories:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## 2. Deep Learning

Deep Learning is the process of implementing Neural Networks on high-dimensional data to gain insights and form solutions. It's an advanced field of Machine Learning that can be used to solve more advanced problems.

Deep Learning is the logic behind applications such as face verification algorithms on Facebook, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

## 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing refers to the science of drawing insights from natural human language in order to communicate with machines and grow businesses.

Twitter uses NLP to filter out terroristic language in tweets, while Amazon uses NLP to understand customer reviews and improve user experience.

## 4. Robotics

Robotics is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on different branches and applications of robots. AI Robots are artificial agents acting in a real-world environment to produce results by taking accountable actions.

Sophia the humanoid is a good example of AI in robotics.

## 5. Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is a computing approach based on the principles of “degrees of truth” instead of the usual modern computer logic, which is boolean in nature.

Fuzzy logic is used in the medical fields to solve complex problems involving decision-making. It's also used in automatic gearboxes, vehicle environment control, and more.

## 6. Expert Systems

An expert system is an AI-based computer system that learns and reciprocates the decision-making ability of a human expert.

Expert systems use if-then logical notations to solve complex problems and are mainly used in information management, medical facilities, loan analysis, virus detection, and more.

**A Complete Guide to Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Definition of Machine Learning:**

Machine learning employs mathematical and statistical approaches to enable computers to "learn" from data, improving their performance in solving tasks.

**Machine Learning Process:**

1. **Gather and Clean Data**: Collect and preprocess data, representing a large dataset.
2. **Learn and Understand Data**: Identify trends and patterns within the data.
3. **Build Model**: Develop a model that understands the data and makes decisions based on it.
4. **Train Model**: Feed the model with training data (70%-80% of the dataset).
5. **Validate Model**: Test the model's performance with the remaining data.
6. **Iterate**: Based on results, refine the model if necessary.

**Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:**

1. **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**
2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms**
3. **Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Supervised Machine Learning:**

- Involves labeled data, aiming to learn the relationship between features and a target variable.
- Categorized into regression (continuous output) and classification (discrete output) problems.

**Unsupervised Machine Learning:**

- Deals with unlabeled data to infer intrinsic data structures.
- Algorithms include clustering and association rule learning.

**Reinforcement Learning:**

- Focuses on maximizing rewards by learning from feedback.
- Used in game theory and simulation optimization methods.

**List of Machine Learning Algorithms (Categories):**

- Regression, Instance-based Learning, Regularization, Decision Tree, Bayesian, Kernel-based, Clustering, Association Rule Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, and Integrated Algorithms.

**Machine Learning Applications:**

- Finance (Risk Management, Fraud Detection), Customer Service, Technology (Email Filtering), Healthcare, Automobile (Pattern Recognition), Telecoms (Facial Recognition).

**Conclusion:**

Machine learning offers a powerful framework for making sense of data and driving innovation across industries. Understanding its concepts and algorithms is crucial for leveraging its potential effectively.
