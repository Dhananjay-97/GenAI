# Branches Of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence can be used to solve real-world problems by implementing the following processes/techniques:

## 1. Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science of getting machines to interpret, process, and analyze data in order to solve real-world problems.

Under Machine Learning there are three categories:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## 2. Deep Learning

Deep Learning is the process of implementing Neural Networks on high-dimensional data to gain insights and form solutions. It's an advanced field of Machine Learning that can be used to solve more advanced problems.

Deep Learning is the logic behind applications such as face verification algorithms on Facebook, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

## 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing refers to the science of drawing insights from natural human language in order to communicate with machines and grow businesses.

Twitter uses NLP to filter out terroristic language in tweets, while Amazon uses NLP to understand customer reviews and improve user experience.

## 4. Robotics

Robotics is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on different branches and applications of robots. AI Robots are artificial agents acting in a real-world environment to produce results by taking accountable actions.

Sophia the humanoid is a good example of AI in robotics.

## 5. Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic is a computing approach based on the principles of “degrees of truth” instead of the usual modern computer logic, which is boolean in nature.

Fuzzy logic is used in the medical fields to solve complex problems involving decision-making. It's also used in automatic gearboxes, vehicle environment control, and more.

## 6. Expert Systems

An expert system is an AI-based computer system that learns and reciprocates the decision-making ability of a human expert.

Expert systems use if-then logical notations to solve complex problems and are mainly used in information management, medical facilities, loan analysis, virus detection, and more.
